Minutes from this Meeting
    This sprint went well. We got much more done compared to sprint 1. Mostly because we are all more comfortable with the framework we are using now. It makes it much easier to accomplish tasks when everyone is on the same page when it comes to the framework, and everyone is able to program and develop without challenges. The biggest challenge for us during this sprint was OAuth. We thought setting it and getting it working up would be much easier than it turned out to be. However, we were still able to get it working. We still need to create a way to add approved accounts to it though. So we can give access to our program to people that buy our software. Outside of OAuth, the only issues we had were with time. It’s been a ton of work, but we have been able to stay in front of it and not fall behind. We are on pace heading into sprint 3. The things in our backlog that we didn’t finish were things relating to OAuth, which we should have done by the start of sprint 3, and some decorative aspects. Those are not a high priority and even without them our program still looks very good. We mostly caught up from where we ended sprint 1. We are all very confident in our ability to have a complete finished and well made program by the end of sprint 3 for our presentation. We as a team know exactly what we need to do to be ready for sprint 3 and how we can use the things we learned in sprint 2 going forward.
