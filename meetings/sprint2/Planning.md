Minutes
    We established our goal for sprint 2 which is to have a working version of the menu board, the kiosk view and the kitchen view. We are also aiming to get a majority of our api’s working, including oauth and the google translate api’s. Our biggest blocker is time. We are slightly worried about how much time sprint 2 will take.
