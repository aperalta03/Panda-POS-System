Minutes from this Meeting
    Our sprint goal is to get a functional version of each view. Our fist of five was a 3.8. We are confident we will be able to finish our goal by the end of sprint 2. OAuth turned out to be a little bit of a problem, but we put another person on it. This should allow us to finish it on time. We are almost done with all the backend, and we will soon start testing and debugging. Our program should be running smoothly by sprint 3
