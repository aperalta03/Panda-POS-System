Minutes from Previous Meeting
    We ultimately decided to go with node for our back end frame work and react for our front end
    frame work. Now we need to go throught the process of making sure everyone can actually use node
    effectively. Our sprint goal is to get a working version of our project 2 using react and node. 
    Our fist of five was a 4.2. We assinged who was working on what in the sprint backlog. Go look at 
    that to see who is working on what.
