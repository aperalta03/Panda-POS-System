    The goal for this sprint is to start our prgram and get something working for the demo. We are aiming
    to effectively have our MVP for sprint 1 to look like our finished product from project 2. We also want to
    get some of our api's working, specifically OAuth to create a way to login. Our biggest concern is deciding what framework and what language we want to use
