Minutes from Previous Meeting
    Our sprint goal is to get a working version of our project 2 using react and node. Our fist of five 
    was 2.5. We know we are probably not finished everything we want to by the end of this sprint. There
    are still a few things that we haven't been able to convert over, but it's not too much (about 6 story points). It's mostly a few things here and there plus the database connection. Our biggest blocker is getting the database connection to work. Right now we are having a pathing issud. We are still on a good
    pace for the demo, and ideally we will have the database connection by tonight.
