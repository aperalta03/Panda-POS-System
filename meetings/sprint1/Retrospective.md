Minutes from Previous Meeting
Porting things over to react and creating the framework went very well. It was much easier than we expected. The database connection was the only thing we struggled on, but we got it working. We had no issues with our procedure. We may need to give bigger time estimates on the product backlog, but that is something we will monitor going forward.
